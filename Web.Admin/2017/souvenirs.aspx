        <h2>Souvenirs</h2>
        <p>Moreno Shirts  $40.00 The tangerine is the only color that will not be offered on the website as the officials will be wearing them. 
Bunny Hugs  $45.00 for either style
Jackets men and ladies  $55.00  Men tall starting at Large  $65.00 
I am attaching pictures of the towels and Cozies for water bottles that will be available on line. They will both be $15 unless they want them personalized, then there will be a $1.50 charge for personalizing them, increasing the cost to $16.50. Not sure if Judy got back to you with the shirts, jackets, bunny hugs. I will need to know how many of these two items have been ordered so I can let that supplier know. We would like to have on-line sales start by the middle of April, with cut off June 1. We will have towels at the event, but will not be able to personalize them, and water bottle Coozies will only be on-line sales. Thanks.</p>
